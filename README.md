--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## Expected User Journey
* User starts chat with the Chatbot
* Chatbot asks for their Number plate if there are none in the, and user provides(if they have used the chatbot before, it should provide previously used number plates)
* Chatbot sends the number plate to the parking api, and parking api returns to the chatbot if it exists or not. If it exists, returns with amount due, and duration of stay, and a cta to pay. If not, user is asked to input valid number plate.
* Once user clicks Pay, the chatbot asks them to confirm the number they are paying with(if they have used the chatbot before, it should show previously used numbers)
* Once user selects or inputs the number, the chatbot lets them know to check their phone for an mpesa prompt
* If user pays Successfully; the Chatbot should message the user, letting them know that they have paid successfully, for Number plate x - duration of stay.
* The chatbot should also send a positive trigger to the Parking api, letting it know that number plate x has been paid, and hence approved to be opened.
* If user's payment fails, the chatbot should let the user know that payment has failed, and should also send a negative trigger to the parking api, letting it know number plate x payment failed, hence state to stay unpaid and closed.
